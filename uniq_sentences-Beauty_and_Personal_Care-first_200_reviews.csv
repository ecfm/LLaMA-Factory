Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_0,Opened the package & instant migraine.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_1,I cannot believe the stench.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_2,"I have purchased other packages that did not smell at all so I do not know if these were a damaged shipment or damaged during packaging or what, but the minute I opened the Amazon package I smelled it before I even opened the Terra Tattoos package."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_3,Then I find that the pink inks from the back have smeared all over the fronts of the tattoos.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_4,"Yes, you eventually take the clear part off to apply the tattoo, but I always lay it down with the clear covering first to line it up & I didn’t want to risk the pink ink transferring to my art projects so it’s going back."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_5,I’ll update the review when Amazon sends my replacement.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_6,"I’m upset because now my resin is here & I don’t have the tattoos to do my project, but I’m more mad about the fact that I have a massive migraine because of the gasoline fumes that lingered."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_7,"I believe they arrived a week ago, but I didn’t check the tattoos then as I didn’t have resin & the smell of gasoline is just as string toast when I opened them to check them as it was last week when I forgot to start the return."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_8,I’ve been sick or I would have done it already.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_9,I really hope the replacement tattoos are okay.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_10,These have massive gaps at pump nozzle.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_11,Tops the list for worst purchase.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_12,Tried these for alcohol inks.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_13,My mistake was not checking that every bottle would spray before filling them.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_14,They both sprayed so I proceeded.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_15,There is a gap where the pump is so if you shake your ink up and down it literally comes out the top which is why these are such a mess and if you knock it over the ink escapes.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_16,"Luckily I worked over my sink or the mess would have been worse, but I’m still wearing  a lot of ink days later."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_17,These were a debacle start to finish.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_18,I should have checked the bottles better before putting my ink in.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_19,"1/4 work okay, but will still spill ink if knocked over or shaken."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_20,"1/4 spray, but the spray is like a diagonal slash pattern not a nice round spray pattern  1/2 won’t spray at all."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_21,Literally worst amazon purchase ever & now my inks are trapped in an item I need to return!!!
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_22,Bought this for my granddaughter.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_23,Her entire family including her 4 siblings & mom & dad love doing these.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_24,Not sharp enough to cut smoothly.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_25,These are extremely dull and will wreck your nails.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_26,They were not sharpened apparently.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_27,"It’s a complete waste of money, but luckily Amazon refunded me."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_28,"Pretty, but didn’t close correctly."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_29,Mine wouldn’t close correctly so I sent it back.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_30,"It’s pretty and useful, but expect it to close properly."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_31,Unbottled disappointment I don't often leave negative feedback about products - it really has to be a pretty poorly made product for that to happen.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_32,"Unfortunately, these bottles are super leaky, even with the rollerball tightly secured and the lid properly screwed on."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_33,"The screw-on lids seem a poor fit for the bottles, and one of them leaked all over a leather purse in which the bottle was being carried, ruining it."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_34,"(First world problems, I know)."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_35,"I contacted Amazon to see about a refund, but the only way they would refund the purchase is if I returned the bottles - which are filled with essential oil blends, and I would have to dump it all out to send the bottles back, or buy another set of bottles and try to transfer the oil over."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_36,"For $9 it wasn't worth all that, even with the $5 additional credit they offered, so I had to chalk this up as a loss and a &#34;buyer beware - read the reviews!&#34; So please - read the reviews."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_37,I'm not the only one who had this problem!
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_38,"(Also, note the number of people who received a discount or received this product for free in exchange for leaving a review)."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_39,"Based on other reviews, I thought this would be a great product."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_40,"I was surprised and disappointed to discover that this shade is truly colorless on my lips, and it doesn't possess any noticeable plumping factor."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_41,"Also, other reviewers mentioned that this burns quite a bit and I totally disagree."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_42,There is some level of slight burning but it's very subtle.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_43,"I've tried other lip plumpers that work much better, such as the Physician's Formula Plump Potion."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_44,"While very sticky, that particular gloss does do what it's advertised to do."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_45,The NYX Pump it Up gloss really isn't worth the money.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_46,"Anyway, people looking for long-lasting plumping won't really get results from a lip gloss - that usually requires some sort of collagen injection, and I'm not about to go there."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_47,I'll just have to be satisfied with my less-than-Angelina pout and chalk it up to genetics.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_48,Five Stars This stuff smells amazing.... got it for my man.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_49,OK I have used PFB vanish normally and decided to try this set instead.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_50,"Very heavy alcohol with the tend skin, it does work however but its just OK in my book."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_51,I will definitely keep and use but not sure I'd repurchase.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_52,The roller/travel item- its nice that it can be refilled but just doesn't work all that well.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_53,Neutral set flatters most Nice set at a reasonable price.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_54,I got a few for gifts.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_55,I will say the lipstick is a bit grainy/dry but the color is very pretty.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_56,I mix it with balm or gloss to wear
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_57,These are very cute but they are quite small and the quality of the clips varies quite a bit.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_58,Beautiful palette- very pleased .
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_59,I got one as a gift and one for myself.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_60,Great range of both fun and neutral colors.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_61,"I returned this item because it had terrible coverage, similar to using a skin tone primer."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_62,The consistency is high in dimethicone/silicone ingredients and very low on pigment.<br /><br />Save your money and buy Kryolan brand makeup instead.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_63,Their heaviest coverage covers tattoos and bruises which is exactly what I was looking for.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_64,My favorite colored-hair shampoo and conditioner!!!
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_65,The scent is fresh like apples and the lather is nice without being stripping to the hair.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_66,The conditioner replenishes whatever the shampoo removes and did I say I love the scent??
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_67,☺️ Good sizes for the price....
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_68,PSA TO ALL CRAVING DIRT: CHECK YOUR IRON LEVELS!!!!!!!
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_69,I used to work for Sephora.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_70,This definitely smells like fresh soil.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_71,We never understood why people actually bought it.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_72,"Decades later, I found out those with anemia and iron deficiency have cravings to eat or smell dirt."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_73,They also get cravings to eat ice.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_74,"Severe anxiety is another symptom and if you drink a lot of caffeine, you are probably low."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_75,"Please see a hematologist to get your iron ferritin checked, asap."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_76,"With 3 girls, we go through a LOT of hair ties!"
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_77,These are wonderful and there are a ton of them!!
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_78,They fit around my pointer finger… about 1”.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_79,Doesn't work for THICK hair .
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_80,I have thick hair and have to use 3 of these to keep my hair up.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_81,My hair is about to my collar bone and if it was longer might be easier to keep up.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_82,I thought these were great the first time I tried but then my hair kept falling down so I had to keep adding more clips to keep my hair up.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_83,I will probably just end up purchasing a more expensive higher quality French twist comb for my thick hair.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_84,Oh also the prongs after a few uses are already bending and coming out of shape.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_85,Not a horrible comb but not that good either.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_86,good cetaphil is like the best lotion on planet earth.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_87,super good for sensitive skin

Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_91,He said he will never go back to disposable razors again!
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_92,He said there was no learning curve at all switching from disposable to safety razors!
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_93,Three Stars Not as easy to apply as liquid eyeliner.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_94,Five Stars Been using this product for years & I love it!
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_95,What a nice scrub this is.

Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_97,The scrub is effective and the product rinses well.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_98,You will need moisturizer afterward.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_99,I live in AZ so I'm always dry.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_100,This stuff is a luxurious vacation in a bottle.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_101,It smells heavenly but not overwhelming at all.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_102,"My hair is so soft, I didn't need conditioner."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_103,Bets stuff for a fraction of what some cost.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_104,this smells weird I love this brand of sugar scrub but this is the first time I tried the lemon and its weird.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_105,it also was shipped and left out in the heat causing the package to leak so maybe that was the issue.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_106,Put it up off my neck!
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_107,I used these from the age of 16.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_108,Waist length hair and TX heat made me a way to get it off my neck.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_109,Wrapping up the hair around my hand and start pinning up.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_110,Holds tightly all day long.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_111,Great sunscreen with minimal smell.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_112,If you spray slowly you'll see some white from the minerals but it rubs in easily.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_113,I put it on every morning.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_114,There is a slight odor but it dissipates quickly.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_115,I kept two and gave one as a gift.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_116,"I bought this to create work appropriate looks, and it works well for that."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_117,"I think it would be a better palate if it included a darker shade, however."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_118,Good mix of matte and shimmer shades.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_119,It's much less expensive ($5?)
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_120,on amazon than at CVS.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_121,Great for thick heavy hair.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_122,"One clip will hold my slippery, heavy hair up all day!"
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_123,great sunscreen stick I bought this to protect my tattoo from the sun and I think it's going to do a great job.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_124,"The stick is easy to apply, feels nice against my skin, and even smells nice."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_125,Zinc oxide is the way to go when you want strong uv protection.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_126,Great Brand of Zinc Oxide Sunscreens This sunscreen is fantastic.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_127,A lot of zinc oxide sunscreens are greasy or chalky but this has a great consistency - it's thick and rubs in well.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_128,I prefer not to use chemical sunscreens because they don't block the full UV spectrum.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_129,Smells wonderful AND anti bacterial too!
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_130,"very cute delivery, not good."

Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_155,Not study by any means
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_156,Not kinky hair Very silky and not human kinky hair.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_157,Will not work for my class.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_158,But my fault for not reading more about it before being excited and just buying.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_159,"Good quality On time, good quality,  just what I was looking for."

Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_162,Great and lots of choices on lashes easy The magnetic eyeliner and eyelashes kit was actually a great choice for me first time using magnetic.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_163,These lashes were very easy to apply.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_164,I gave adhesion 4 stars but that might have been the way I applied eyeliner??
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_165,They did stay put except for a little on end so probably me.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_166,I love the fact you have choices and easy to remove makeup remover or baby oil.

Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_171,Long hair pulls it all out This brush detangles by pulling out your hair I will gladly send back for a refund no good for long hair

Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_184,I won't be purchasing the gel again.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_185,I just don't like the feeling.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_186,It does the job to those who do like the gel.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_187,These socks are utterly amazing!!!
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_188,My feet were very dry and had lots of cracks that even my pedicure lady couldn’t eliminate with all her tools.

Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_192,DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY!
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_193,This is very nice and sturdy.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_194,The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the design is a bit flawed.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_195,The top tier should be higher to accommodate perfumes on the bottom.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_196,I have all the space under the top shelf that I can’t use because my bottles are too tall.

Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_209,The results are absolutely amazing but I feel sick after using this even though I took precautions.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_210,"I wore gloves, had 3 windows open and 2 fans blowing fumes away."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_211,I also wore a face mask but then switched to swim goggles after the fumes started burning my eyes even before I started blow drying.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_212,Pretty results but this stuff is incredibly noxious.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_213,I probably wont use it again for a long time.

Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_269,"The smell, scent of this product is cheap and overpowering."

Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_272,"Conditioner does give softness, but leaves an obvious film."

Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_274,Itchiness and almost greasy within a day.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_275,Darker & redder than expected .
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_276,Box bottles are very similar in the use and design.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_277,Let's say it's just a bit darker and more red undertones than expected.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_278,"Grey's visible in a month, and previous bleach regions (over a year old) could be seen."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_279,Poor consistent saturation of color.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_280,Shipment preparation needs quality control!
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_281,Bottle tops were not taped shut and so product leaked from containers into the outside packaging.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_282,Previous shipment of this product was securely taped without leakage.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_283,One Star This greasy makeup is not worth the money.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_284,Lightweight & fair sized .
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_285,"Has a hole at the top so it can be hung up with anything, not just the little hook provided."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_286,"Large and full, BUT they are not well made."

Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_292,I really like this lipstick.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_293,"It is not overpowering, more of a nice subtle coloring for your lips."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_294,I have a light skin tone - freckle nose reddish hair type of skin color and the berry smoothie works well for me.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_295,"Great price, works well ."

Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_316,It goes on smoothly &  it holds the eyelashes on nice and secure.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_317,It does all this at a fraction of the price I was paying from the eyelash companies.

Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_339,Not much to learn…just two small hair clips doing what they were designed to do .
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_340,"Nothing to dislike, the hair clips do what they were designed to do"
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_341,Pretty butterfly hair clip It’s as ordered
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_342,Clips are pretty but need a longer clip to attach to hair.. .
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_343,Too big I like thee combs but they are.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_344,all too big and bulky
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_345,Handy for travelingp It’s good but there isn’t very much of them for the price
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_346,I DONT know if I would like this or not because neither I nor my husband could get it open!
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_347,Won’t last the day .
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_348,This removes bags under my eyes for a couple of hours but it’s much too expensive
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_349,Works okay and doesn’t make me break out .
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_350,Not perfect but better than nothing during long dry summer days

Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_355,Easy to use eyeliner but.... .
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_356,"This is a good product but it doesn't last very long, making it quite expensive.."

Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_362,Handle carefully My old thinning shears only cut about one out of 100 hairs so I assumed this one would too but I was wrong.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_363,They cut a huge chunk of my hair  right on the front side where it is very noticeable.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_364,"I'll be more careful now, but the damage is done until my hair grows out again...watch out, the shears are more like regular shears."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_365,"Other than that, both shears are of good quality and I'm happy to have them."

Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_370,"She had crusty layers of dry dead skin and within 4 days of using the product 2 to 3 times a day, her nose is like when she was a puppy, soft, smooth and moist."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_371,I will always have this product on hand for her.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_372,I didn't think a scent would be an advantage and could be bothersome.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_373,The color is awesome though.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_374,Wand is way to thick if you want to use it as liner.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_375,Gets all over your lashes and no it does not stay on.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_376,Well it does not stay on like t says.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_377,"And the dark brown is not brown, it's rust/copper."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_378,I gave this is product months of testing before deciding this was an absolute waste of my money.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_379,I wouldn't mind the time it takes to complete if it lastest more than a couple days.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_380,The product is thick and peels up easily then they just pull off after that.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_381,Great aftershave with manly scent.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_382,Works wonders on my sensitive skin.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_383,Use it in minor nicks and cuts and even acne spots to clear up my skin beautifully.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_384,"Works wonders.<br />They have other scents as well and I like all of them, but the classic is my favorite."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_385,This is a perfectly hydrating lotion with a light manly scent.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_386,Works great for daily use or weekly if you don't want to use daily.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_387,I have been using it for 5 years and it has helped me a ton.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_388,Especially in the cold dry winter months.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_389,I tried them I have used silicone patches for my upper chest with good results.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_390,I have some light wrinkling on my upper lip and though silicone patches would work well there.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_391,I purchased these.<br /><br />I wear my patches to bed.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_392,"The first time I wore this patch, it fell off in my bed."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_393,I had to search for it the next morning.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_394,I then wore the second patch.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_395,"It fell off during the night, also."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_396,Falling off defeats the purpose.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_397,"They do not stay on; so therefore, aren’t beneficial."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_398,Great for skincare An esthetician recommended these to me.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_399,I sort of blew the suggestion off.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_400,"Cotton pads are cotton pads, right?"
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_401,Why pay more for cotton pads?<br /><br />I tend to run through skin care products quickly.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_402,"I decided to try these and now use them faithfully.<br /><br />Regular cotton pads tend to soak up all the product, leaving it in the cotton, instead of on your face."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_403,These don’t soak it all up.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_404,They allow you to put the product on your skin.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_405,Less waste of products.<br /><br />They are soft on your skin.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_406,I was let down I have used a similar product from a different company that was sort of expensive.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_407,I thought I would try this set.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_408,"It seemed like a good deal, especially with all the different pieces.<br /><br />The chest piece was fine and seemed to work."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_409,"The forehead piece was so, so."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_410,"It covered the forehead, but the part that goes down between the eyes didn’t cover that well and didn’t stay adhered."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_411,"I wanted it to treat the vertical lines above my nose, between the eyes, but it didn’t work for that."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_412,"The pieces for under the eyes didn’t stay on, thus didn’t work for those lines."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_413,The other pieces in the kit were odd shaped and not appropriate for any where.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_414,"I wanted to treat the lines on my upper lip, but none of the pieces would work."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_415,I really like this stuff I originally got this product elsewhere.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_416,This was my third bottle.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_417,I didn’t notice a scent.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_418,I do wish it were a bit less expensive.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_419,The designs were larger than expected.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_420,I thought there would be a cute little design on the clips.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_421,"What I received was larger, cheap looking, kids dress up things."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_422,"Less sweat, dried feet ."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_423,I am on the fence about this product.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_424,It states to apply 3 times a day at first.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_425,Who has time for that?
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_426,I did apply at least twice a day.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_427,"For the first few days, it did nothing."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_428,"After repeated use, it started to help decrease the sweating of my feed."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_429,"It does state this in the directions.<br /><br />It dries the feet out, which I guess is the point, but aesthetically speaking, it doesn’t look great."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_430,"I want nice looking feet , not over dried looking.<br /><br />The bottle is pretty small ."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_431,It lasted about a month.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_432,"I did buy another bottle, so I could really decide whether I liked it or not.<br /><br />I am still deciding whether to buy another or not."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_433,"Don’t like how my feet look when using it, but I like having less sweaty feet."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_434,"I am wondering how it would work if just used during exercise, when the sweating is worse."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_435,No compact to carry and break I bought a pack of these years ago.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_436,"I used them, then put them to the back of my mind.<br /><br />I don’t wear makeup to work, but have noticed some shine in my tzone."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_437,I didn’t want to carry around a compact.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_438,I can be rough with my work bag.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_439,I bought some oil blotting papers at a store near me.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_440,"I tried a couple different ones, but wasn’t really happy."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_441,I then remembered these babies.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_442,I found them on Amazon and bought a 3 pack.<br /><br />They are compact and easy to carry.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_443,"They have rice powder on them, so it’s like you get to powder your nose at the same time."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_444,They also work on my fair skin.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_445,So so I was expecting a better quality print.
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_446,"So small so have to be kidding me Strange item, so tiny and hard to use..."
Beauty_and_Personal_Care-first_200_reviews_447,"I will not purchase again, way to expensive for such a small item"
